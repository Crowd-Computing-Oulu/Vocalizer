            "FUBAR is just inside the R-Gate and it's one of the most popular places in the FUBAR. The staffs are really friendly although it's a very small restaurant and there are certain area where it's a booth kind of a sofa sitting area but that's really uncomfortable. I think if the sofas were not there rather there are open tables those are good. The restaurant is extremely clean it's very easy the foods are there but they run out of food quite quickly as it's near to most of the classrooms so I think they should they should have more more food more items. One or two times that happens that I went there and found out only vegetarian options are there other than that everything ran out and one day around 13 o'clock time I went there and I found out there is no other foods available. The catch-up section has quite a lot of variety it's a very good place to go. I often go to FUBAR to have lunch.\n"

            "Food Garden is almost at the middle of, in between the WAMC and the University of Hulu campus. It's relatively a smaller restaurant, the seating areas are usually outside, but it's not that easy to get items, you know, seats inside. The restaurant, the place where we take food, it is not that big, so that's why most of the time we can see people are lining up in the corridor as well. The foods are good, but one time I saw in TUDO app that there are different foods listed, but when I went to Food Garden, I found out the items are not given, actually. When I asked the attendant, they said they do not watch the TUDO app, because you have to see our website, which was surprising to me, because for all other restaurants, we actually check out TUDO to find out what's the menu today. Other than that, it's a clean restaurant as well, the staffs are quite friendly, but I do not go to Food Garden that much, because of the lining up in the corridor area, and also it's a bit chaotic over there, as inside there are not many tables, and people usually sit outside, and then you have to turn the tray and clean it, so for this hassle, and I think there is no basin to wash your hands as well. So that's it.\n"

            "Previously, Napa has been pretty bad in user experience or customer experience because people were rude, but from the last period, it has been quite okay. Napa is the only restaurant that opens up till late afternoon. Most of the time, it's a big sitting place, and it's closer to most of the classrooms. There can be two places from where you can take the food, and the foods are warm. The staffs are now quite good, but the bread area is a bit far away. Other than that, it has some problems with the scanners. Most of the time, I see that the To-Do app is not scanned properly. The food items served are quite good, but what I have found out that there is less amount of days when the beef patty is given. The cleanliness is quite good. It's quite well cleaned, but while taking the plates, there is a problem like the salad plates are actually put up on the salad bar. So a lot of the time, I have seen, in fact, myself have done this once, a problem that I took two big plates instead of the smaller salad plates because I didn't actually see them. All in all, Napa is a place, if you are late in your lunch, you know that Napa is open and you can go and have your late lunch in Napa.\n"

It's not in the University of Oulu campus, rather it's on the University of Applied Sciences WAMC side. It's really far away from Tellus area. A lot of the time we don't actually go to Subway and in the Subway what we feel that there is coffee, which is quite good although it's a bit expensive. Other than that, the student discount is quite good over there and you can get typical Subway foods. It's the international standard. The foods are good, the staffs are really friendly, it's really clean. Usually the service is quite quick, you can get a variety of it. The only thing is they do not serve halal meat, so a lot of the Muslim students, they have problem in Subway. They only take tuna sandwich, they cannot have, other than tuna sandwich, they cannot have chicken or others. But I didn't find any other dessert items there, so I think the dessert items should be there, that would be helpful. All in all, it's a good place if you are working late, then it can be a good place where you can go and grab a quick bite of an internationally warm, tasty food.\n"

Overall Castori offers a good customer service experience and the lunch options are very tasty and also nutritious.\n",

I like especially that you can put so many different options of salads to your sandwich and choose also the kind of bread that you want for your sandwich. Overall it was a good experience and the sandwich was filling.\n"
